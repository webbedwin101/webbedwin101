# EyeExercise

## Week 8

### This assignment demonstrates CSS and JS manipulation of HTML classes using the DOM event (onmousemove).
### The "eyes" will follow the user's cursor anywhere on the page based on the cursor's (x, y) coordinates. 
### This creates a fun and interactive experience for the User. 

### Improvements: resize and set as reuseable component
